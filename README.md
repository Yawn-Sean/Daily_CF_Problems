## Today's Problem

| Difficulty | Problems | Hints | Solution |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1700 | [CF457A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/457/A) | You should not use float numbers for this problem. How can you compare the two numbers using only integers? Minusing can help. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/04/0403/solution/cf457a.md) |
| 2000 | [CF870D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/870/D) | Another brain teaser. Why do you only need $2n$ queries while the answer can't be fully determined? | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/04/0403/solution/cf870d.md) |
