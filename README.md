## Today's Problem

| Difficulty | Problems | Hints | Solution |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1800 | [CF914C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/914/C) | The number can decline really quickly. And you only cares about the number of $1$s in the original number. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/05/0514/solution/cf914c.md) |
| 1900 | [CF965D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/965/D) | Brain teaser. If a frog can only jump $l$ units at most, it should "rest" on some segments. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/05/0514/solution/cf965d.md) |
