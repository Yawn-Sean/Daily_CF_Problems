## Today's Problem

| Difficulty | Problems | Hints | Solution |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1700 | [CF1185D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1185/D) | Brain teaser actually. If it is hard to find what's not in the arithmatic progression, is it easier to find what's in it? | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0308/solution/cf1185d.md) |
| 2100 | [CF895D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/895/D) | Seems like a digit DP problem but it isn't actually. String comparison (of equal length) is all about the first different charactor. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0308/solution/cf895d.md) |
