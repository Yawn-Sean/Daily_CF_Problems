## Today's Problem

| Difficulty | Problems | Hints | Solution |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1700 | [CF457A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/457/A) | You should not use float numbers for this problem. How can you compare the two numbers using only integers? Minusing can help. | TBD |
| 2000 | [CF870D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/870/D) | Another brain teaser. Why do you only need $2n$ queries while the answer can't be fully determined? | TBD |
