| Difficulty | Problems | Hints | Solution |
| ---------- | -------- | ----- | -------- |
| *1700 | [GYM105284C](https://codeforces.com/gym/105284/problem/C) | The number of connected components is strongly connected with the number of vertices and edges if there are no cycles. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2025/12/1213/solution/cf105284c.md) |
| *2700 | [GYM105863G](https://codeforces.com/gym/105863/problem/G) | Consider $F(A)$ as the solution of a simple problem. Then for each item about $F(A)$ , we can calculate the number of possible grids that can reach this item. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2025/12/1213/solution/cf105284j.md) |
