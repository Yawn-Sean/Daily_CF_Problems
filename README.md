| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1700 | [CF850A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/850/A) | Consider the problem in a lower dimension. If we fix one point $a$ , we can't have too many points other than $a$ . | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/08/0829/solution/cf850a.md) |
| 2000 | [CF248C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/248/C) | The wall is like a mirror, so kick the ball towards the target "in the mirror".
