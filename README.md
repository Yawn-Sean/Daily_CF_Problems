## Today's Problem

| Difficulty | Problems | Hints | Solution |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1700 | [CF1592C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1592/C) | The xor-sum of every connected component is fixed. Use this fact. | TBD |
| 2000 | [CF1903E](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1903/E) | We only care about the parity of the result. So the sum of the square of the Euclidean distance can be simplified. | TBD |
