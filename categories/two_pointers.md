| Difficulty | Problems | Hints | Solution |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1500 | [CF1547E](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1547/E) | Try plotting the function and find where the function changes. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/tree/main/daily_problems/2024/02/0226) |
| 1600 | [CF924B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/924/B) | Three variables but one can be deleted using greedy. So the problem can be solved with two-pointers | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0327/solution/cf924b.md) |
| 1600 | [CF1196D2](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1196/D2) | There are only $3$ different patterns. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/06/0629/solution/cf1196d2.md) |
| 1700 | [CF631C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/631/C) | Some operations are just useless. If one interval is covered by a larger interval afterwards, what will happen? | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/05/0501/solution/cf631c.md) |
| 2000 | [CF366D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/366/D) | Note that the data range isn't that wide. You can fix the lower bound to find the upper bound. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/06/0627/solution/cf366d.md) |
