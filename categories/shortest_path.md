| Difficulty | Problems | Hints | Solution |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 2100 | [CF301B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/301/B) | Just find the shortest path. Note that $a_i\leq 10^3\leq d$ . | TBD |
| 2200 | [CF567E](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/567/E) | To what extent should an edge be reduced to be on the shortest path? How can you judge an edge is "definitely included in the shortest path"? | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/04/0427/solution/cf567e.md) |
| *2400 | [CF1936C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1936/C) | First, think of a DP approach. Why can't it pass the time limit? How to use a "intermediary" to help? | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0302/solution/cf1936c.md) |
