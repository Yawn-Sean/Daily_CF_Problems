| 1600 | [CF1025B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1025/B) | Hmm... At least one element of the pair. Then, which one? | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0309/solution/cf1025b.md) |
| 1700 | [CF1185D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1185/D) | Brain teaser actually.
