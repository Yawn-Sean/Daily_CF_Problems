| 1800 | [CF1083A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1083/A) | Classic way of thinking a path on the tree: fix the important point. Then consider your DP |[Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0305/solution/cf1083a.md) | 
| 1900 | [CF1076E](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1076/E) | Notice that you only have to answer the question after all updates. How can you maintain the changes during traversal? (Bonus: Answer the queries of points' values while updating.) | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0315/solution/cf1076e.md) |
| 1900 | [CF739B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/739/B) | The controlling points clearly form a segment in the tree. You just need to find the endpoint. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/04/0402/solution/cf739b.md) |
| 2100 | [CF1152D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1152/D) | Try solving the problem in a smaller tree. What information should be necessary for your DP function? | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/02/0228/solution/cf1152d.md) |
| 2100 | [CF576B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/576/B) | Construct a graph using the permutation. For the final tree, construct an edge first, what edges should it produce? Summarize and find the necessary conditions. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0311/solution/cf576b.md) |
