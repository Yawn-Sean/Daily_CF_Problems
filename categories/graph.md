| 1800 | [CF863D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/863/D) | The constraints are strange, especially: $1\leq m\leq 100$ . | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0318/solution/cf863d.md) |
| 1800 | [CF623A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/623/A) | There is only one case where $s_i, s_j$ are not equal or neighboring.
