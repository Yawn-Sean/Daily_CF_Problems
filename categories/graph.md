| 1800 | [CF263D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/263/D) | What are the typical ways of finding cycles in a graph? Which one is appropriate? Prove it! | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0316/solution/cf263d.md) |
| 1800 | [CF863D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/863/D) | The constraints are strange, especially: $1\leq m\leq 100$ . | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0318/solution/cf863d.md) |
| 1800 | [CF623A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/623/A) | There is only one case where $s_i, s_j$ are not equal or neighboring. It is a more important aspect to consider. | TBD |
| 1900 | [CF1012B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1012/B) | Try some random matrix. What can you discover? | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0326/solution/cf1012b.md) |
| 1900 | [CF1220D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1220/D) | Just consider the case where $n=2$. Can you discover anything? Is it sufficent for larger $n$? | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/04/0401/solution/cf1220d.md) |
| 2100 | [CF576B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/576/B) | Construct a graph using the permutation. For the final tree, construct an edge first, what edges should it produce? Summarize and find the necessary conditions. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0311/solution/cf576b.md) |
| 2200 | [CF1498E](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1498/E) | The competition graph has its important property! Think of the out-degree of strongly connected components. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0301/solution/cf1498e.md) |
| *2400 | [CF1936C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1936/C) | First, think of a DP approach. Why can't it pass the time limit? How to use a "intermediary" to help? | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0302/solution/cf1936c.md) |
