| Difficulty | Problems | Hints | Solution |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1600 | [CF444A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/444/A) | Maximization: if you adjust your answer slightly, it is no way that the answer gets better. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/04/0405/solution/cf444a.md) |
| 1700 | [CF457A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/457/A) | You should not use float numbers for this problem. How can you compare the two numbers using only integers? Minusing can help. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/04/0403/solution/cf457a.md) |
| 1800 | [CF986B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/986/B) | How does a swap change the property of an array? What is the difference between $3n$ and $7n+1$ ? | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/03/0325/solution/cf986b.md) |
| 1800 | [CF1016D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1016/D) | Brain teaser. Two ways of thinking: What is the necessary condition? / How can you try to satisfy more conditions when you already have a partly-right result? | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/04/0401/solution/cf1016d.md) |
| 2000 | [CF870D](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/870/D) | Another brain teaser. Why do you only need $2n$ queries while the answer can't be fully determined? | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/04/0403/solution/cf870d.md) |
| 2000 | [CF1903E](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1903/E) | We only care about the parity of the result. So the sum of the square of the Euclidean distance can be simplified. | [Editorial](https://github.com/Yawn-Sean/Daily_CF_Problems/blob/main/daily_problems/2024/04/0411/solution/cf1903e.md) |
