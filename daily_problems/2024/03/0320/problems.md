| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1600 | [CF375A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/375/A) | Note the strange constraint: its decimal representation quite luckily contains digits 1, 6, 8, 9. |
| 2000 | [CF571B](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/571/B) | Group the elements, and minimize the sum inside. Design the final DP and control the complexity. |
