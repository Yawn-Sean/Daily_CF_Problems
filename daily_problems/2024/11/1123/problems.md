| Difficulty | Problems | Hints |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1600 | [CF337C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/337/C) | Greedily arrange the correct problems. You should make the number of doubles as small as possible and as early as possible. |
| 2400 | [CF441E](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/441/E) | The suffix of the original number is not changed much. |
